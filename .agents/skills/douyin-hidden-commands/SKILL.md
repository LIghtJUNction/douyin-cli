# Douyin CLI Hidden Commands

Use this skill to discover and operate douyin command surfaces that are easy
to miss from the default help output. Treat "hidden" here as two categories:
Click-hidden commands and non-primary command surfaces that are intentionally
documented less prominently than the official OpenAPI flow.

## Discovery Workflow

Inspect command registration before answering. Start with:

```bash
rg -n "hidden=|@.*command|add_command|invoke_without_command|cookie-login|obscura" douyin_cli README.md tests
uv run douyin --help
uv run douyin auth --help
uv run douyin obscura --help
```

Use `DOUYIN_HOME=/tmp/douyin-hidden-check` when commands may read or write
auth/config state during verification.

## Hidden Or Easy-To-Miss Commands

### `douyin comment`

`douyin comment` is Click-hidden in `douyin_cli/commands/comment.py`, so it is
not listed in the root help. Use it for webpage-cookie comment collection from a
single aweme/note URL.

```bash
douyin comment "https://www.douyin.com/video/..."
douyin comment "https://www.douyin.com/video/..." --limit 100 --output comments.jsonl
```

It uses saved Cookie auth by default and also accepts `--cookie` for one-off
runs. Do not confuse this with official OpenAPI comment commands under
`douyin api`, which require `access_token`, `open_id`, and appropriate scopes.

### `douyin auth cookie-login`

Cookie auth commands live under `douyin auth` but are separate from the official
OpenAPI OAuth path. Use them for webpage-compatible crawling/search/comment
flows that need browser Cookie state.

```bash
douyin auth cookie-login --cookie "sessionid=...; ttwid=..."
douyin auth cookie-status
douyin auth cookie-logout
```

Cookie values are saved in the user config file, not the repository:
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/douyin/config/settings.json`,
`~/.config/douyin/config/settings.json`, or
`%APPDATA%\douyin\config\settings.json`. Use `DOUYIN_HOME` to isolate tests.

### Root Compatibility Crawl

The root command can run the legacy webpage crawler directly when URL/search
options are provided. This is not a subcommand, so command discovery must inspect
`douyin_cli/commands/root.py` and `douyin_cli/commands/compat.py`.

```bash
douyin -u "二手车" -t search -l 5 --no-download
douyin -u "https://www.douyin.com/video/..." -t aweme
douyin -u "https://www.douyin.com/user/..." -t post -l 20
```

Use saved Cookie auth or pass `--cookie` for a single run. When no crawl options
are provided, the root command prints help instead of crawling.

### `douyin obscura`

Obscura commands are automation metadata helpers. Use them when another tool or
agent needs machine-readable command metadata or local Obscura detection.

```bash
douyin obscura manifest
douyin obscura status
douyin obscura status --binary obscura
```

Prefer JSON outputs from Obscura/status surfaces for automation rather than
parsing human help text.

## Verification

For command-surface changes, run targeted help and tests:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_cookie_status.py tests/test_obscura.py tests/test_comments.py
DOUYIN_HOME=/tmp/douyin-hidden-check uv run douyin auth --help
DOUYIN_HOME=/tmp/douyin-hidden-check uv run douyin obscura manifest
```

If full CLI help is involved, also verify Windows-style encoding behavior:

```bash
PYTHONIOENCODING=cp1252 uv run python -m douyin_cli.cli --help
```

Avoid running live Douyin network requests unless the user explicitly asks for
real endpoint validation or provides valid Cookie/OpenAPI credentials.
